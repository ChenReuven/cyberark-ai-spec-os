## Your system for spec-driven agentic development.

**CyberArk AI Spec OS** transforms AI coding agents from confused interns into productive developers. With structured workflows that capture your standards, your stack, and the unique details of your codebase, CyberArk AI Spec OS gives your agents the specs they need to ship quality code on the first tryâ€”not the fifth.

Cyberark AI Spec OS is based on multiple framework but the based one is [Agent OS](https://ChenReuven.com/cyberark-ai-spec-os)

Use it with:

âœ… Claude Code, Cursor, or any other AI coding tool. (Github Copilot is also in progress)

âœ… New products or established codebases.

âœ… Big features, small fixes, or anything in between.

âœ… Any language or framework.
