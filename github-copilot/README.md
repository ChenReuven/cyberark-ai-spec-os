# GitHub Copilot Integration for Agent OS

This directory contains GitHub Copilot-specific adaptations of Agent OS workflows and patterns.

## Overview

Agent OS provides structured development workflows that can be enhanced with GitHub Copilot's AI assistance. This integration allows you to:

1. **Leverage AI-Driven Development**: Use GitHub Copilot's suggestions within Agent OS structured workflows
2. **Maintain Consistent Patterns**: Follow Agent OS standards while getting AI assistance
3. **Accelerate Development**: Combine structured planning with AI-powered code generation

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Product Planning with Copilot
When using GitHub Copilot for product planning:
- Reference the `.agent-os/instructions/core/plan-product.md` file
- Use Agent OS templates for roadmap creation
- Let Copilot suggest implementation approaches within Agent OS structure

### 2. Feature Development
For feature development with GitHub Copilot:
- Start with `.agent-os/instructions/core/create-spec.md` patterns
- Use Copilot for code generation following `.agent-os/standards/` guidelines
- Maintain Agent OS task tracking structure

### 3. Code Review and Quality
GitHub Copilot can assist with:
